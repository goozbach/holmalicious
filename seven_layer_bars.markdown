Seven Layer Bars
----------------

- 1/2 cup butter
- 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs (you can buy just crumbs or you can crush about 12 whole crackers)
- 1 14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk (NOT evaporated milk)
- 1 6 oz package semi sweet chocolate chips
- 1 6 oz. package butterscotch chips
- 1 1/3 cups flaked coconut
- 1 cup chopped nuts (I use walnuts)
 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In 13 x 9-inch pan, melt butter in oven.  Sprinkle graham crumbs over melted butter.  Pat down to form crust.  Pour sweetened condensed milk over crumbs.  Top evenly with remaining ingredients.  Press down firmly.  Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool.  Cut into bars.
