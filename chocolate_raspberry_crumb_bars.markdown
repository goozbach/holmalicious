Chocolate Raspberry Crumb Bars
------------------------------
 
- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened (not melted, just let come to room temp)
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups (12-ounce package) semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 1 1/4 cups (14-ounce can) sweetened condensed milk
- 1/2 chopped walnuts
- 1/3 cup seedless raspberry jam
 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Beat butter in large mixer bowl until creamy.  (You can do this by hand, but an electric mixer is easier).  Beat in flour, sugar and salt until well mixed.  With floured fingers, press 1 1/4 cups crumb mixture onto bottom of greased 13 x 9-inch baking pan; reserve the remaining crumb mixture.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until edges are golden brown.
 
Combine 1 cup of the choc chips and sweetened condensed milk in small, heavy-duty saucepan.  Melt over low heat, stirring until smooth.  Spread over hot crust.
 
Stir nuts into reserved crumb mixture; sprinkle over chocolate filling.  Drop teaspoonfuls of raspberry jam over crumb mixture.  Sprinkle with remaining 1 cup of choc chips.  Continue baking for 25 to 30 minutes or until center is set.  Cool completely on wire rack.
