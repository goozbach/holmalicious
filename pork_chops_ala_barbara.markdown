Pork Chops Ala Barbara
----------------------

Brown pork chops in a small amount of oil.  This should only take a few
minutes.  Add 1/4 cup soy sauce and 3/4 cup water, bring to boil.
Reduce heat and simmer for about 1 hour.   To thicken sauce, mix about a
teaspoon of cornstarch in about a 1/2 cup of water and add to pork
chops.

You may need more water/soy sauce if the liquid gets low.  You can
experiment with the amount of cornstarch needed to thicken the sauce.
