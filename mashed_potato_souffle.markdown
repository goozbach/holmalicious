Mashed Potato Souffle
---------------------

- 8 medium potatoes, peeled and cooked
- 1/4 pound butter, melted
- 1 8 oz. cream cheese
- 1 8 oz. sour cream
- dash garlic salt
- dash pepper
- 2-3 green onions, chopped
- 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
 
Cook the potatoes by boiling in water. (Usually takes about 20 min--it helps to quarter them before cooking).  Mash the potatoes with the butter.  Fold in cream cheese, all seasonings, and sour cream.  Place in buttered casserole dish.  Top with cheddar cheese.  Bake uncovered at 350 degrees for 1 hour.
